# Handwritten Digit Generation with GANs

This directory explores the generation of handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It includes implementations of different GAN architectures.

## About GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of deep learning models introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014. They consist of two neural networks competing against each other:

1.  **Generator (G):** Tries to generate data (in this case, images of digits) that looks realistic, starting from random noise.
2.  **Discriminator (D):** Tries to distinguish between real data (from the actual dataset) and fake data generated by the Generator.

Through this adversarial process, the Generator learns to produce increasingly realistic data, while the Discriminator becomes better at spotting fakes.

## Deep Convolutional GAN (DC-GAN)

Directory: [`DC-GAN/`](./DC-GAN/)

Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) represent a key advancement using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) effectively within the GAN framework. DC-GANs achieve more stable training and generate higher-quality images compared to earlier GANs.

**Kaggle Notebook:** Implementation can be found in this Kaggle notebook: [DC-GAN on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedmohiey/dc-gan)

### Output Example

Below is an example of generated digits from a trained DC-GAN. Unlike the cGAN, these digits are generated randomly from the noise vector without specific conditioning on a digit label.

## Conditional GAN (cGAN)

Directory: [`Conditional-GAN/`](./Conditional-GAN/)

Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for generating specific handwritten digits (0-9) based on the MNIST dataset. Unlike a standard GAN, a cGAN learns to generate data conditioned on some additional information, typically class labels.

**Kaggle Notebook:** Implementation can be found in this Kaggle notebook: [Conditional GAN on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedmohiey/conditional-gan)

**Conditioning Mechanism:**

* **Label Preparation :** Takes integer labels (0-9) and converts them into two one-hot encoded formats suitable for the networks:
    1.  **Vector (`one_hot_labels_vec`):** Shape `(B, C)`. Used for concatenating with the noise vector for the Generator input.
    2.  **Map (`one_hot_labels_map`):** Shape `(B, C, H, W)`. Created by repeating the vector across spatial dimensions (H, W = 28, 28). Used for concatenating with the image tensor for the Discriminator input.

### Output Example

An example grid showing generated digits (0-9) produced by the trained Conditional GAN after 50 epochs.
